Tiger |T1| The tigers are critically threatened.  It's not good.|

Orangutan |T2| Orangutans are also in trouble.  Because of the whole habitat loss thing.|

Giant Panda |VU| Yep, Giant Pandas are threatened too, although less so now.  They're very cute.|

Blue Whale |T2| Blue Whales are in trouble - they eat a lot, they live in the sea, seas are kind of a mess right now.|

Asian Elephant |T1| These are the elephants with the tiny ears.  Everyone wants their tusks.  Very sad.|

Gorilla |VU| They were on the list of endangered species, so I have to believe it is true.  Jane Goodall is not happy.|

Snow Leopard |T1|  Makes sense that these are endangered.  They have snow in their name, and there's the whole global warming thing.|

Rhinoceros |T1| These are also endangered because of their tusks.  What is it about tusks??  Just let the animal that grew 'em keep 'em!|

Sea Turtle |VU| These animals have been around for 100 million years, and, yep, we're about to wipe that out.  Quite an accomplishment, in a bad way...|

Sea Otter |T1| They live near Alaska mostly.  There used to be 300,000.  Now?  3000.|

African Wild Dog |T1| Okay, so this particular dog isn't terribly cute, but it is really seriously endangered, and I don't wish for it to be extinct!|

Amur Leopard |T1| This animal is seriously hurting because it has a beautiful coat, and people keep hunting it for its coat.  Like the leopard doesn't need its coat.  Let the leopard keep its coat, people!|

Axolotl |T2| No idea what this is.  But it was on the list of endangered species.  Should probably google it.|

Black-footed Ferrets |T2| Get this - this ferret is only found in North America and eats animals its own size. | 

Chimpanzees |VU| Yep, we're wiping out the habitat of the species most closely related to us.  Good job humans!|

Galapagos Penguins |T2|  My guess is that the Galapagos Islands are going to be under water shortly, so any animal with the word 'Galapagos' in their name is probably in trouble.|

Golden Lion Tamarins |VU| Poor Golden Lion Tamarins.  Their habitat is going away.  Poor, poor Golden Lion Tamarins.|

Mexican Wolf |T1| By the '0s, the Mexican wolf was almost wiped out. Because of this, the United States and Mexico governments captured the remaining wolves in the wild alive. In the most recent study in 2017, there were 240 Mexican wolves in breeding programs, estimated to be 143 in the wild. |

Key Largo Woodrat |T1| Once the Key Largo woodrat roamed throughout most of Key Largo, the woodrat is now limited to the Northwest Regions, reducing its habitat dramatically.| 

Carolina Northern Flying Squirrel | LC | The flying squirrels can glide a distance of approximately 65 feet and speed to eight miles per hour. Due to the hemlock forests being reduced by an invasive insect called the hemlock woolly adelgid, their natural habitat has been decimated. Their decline was one of the first warnings to scientists that the high-elevation forests’ health was at risk.|

Jaguarundi | EW | The Gulf Coast jaguarundi has been on the endangered list since 1977. Although not confirmed in the U.S. since 1986, there have been sightings in south Texas and northern Mexico. In 2014, the government developed a recovery, although the building of the Mexico-U.S border fence may be their biggest threat as it hinders migration.|

Ocelot | LC | Although rare in North America, Ocelots can still be found in Mexico and every country South, except Chile.  The North American range of the ocelot once included Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. Now there are approximately fifty ocelots living in Texas.  Vehicles are the primary cause of ocelot deaths in Texas, and the Texas Department of Transportation have plans to install the first highway wildlife crossing tunnels in Texas. |

False Killer Whale | NT | The false killer whale is actually a dolphin. The false killer whales in North America have been listed as endangered since 2012, and there are an estimated 150 – 200 living in the Hawaii area, a number that has been declining recently.|

Caribou | NT | Woodland Caribou live in some of the coldest climates in Canada.  With the loss of habitat due to logging, caribou are forced to move to new habitats. Wolves and other predators not in the previous habitat prey on the caribou. Climate change is also resulting in ice covering the tundra’s vegetation, and more frequent forest fires, killing their food source. |

Arabian oryx | VU | In the early 1970s hunting had completely wiped out the species in the wild. However, a slew of reintroduction schemes steered population numbers upwards, so that by 2011, the animal became the first to regain vulnerable status after being listed as extinct in the wild. Today, there are around 1,200 Arabian oryx living freely in Saudi Arabia, with another up to 7,000 in captivity. Unfortunately, they are still hunted for their meat, horns, and skins. |

California Condor | T1 | The California condor is the largest North American land bird. It became extinct in the wild in 1987, but has since been reintroduced to Arizona, Utah, California, and northern Baja California in Mexico. Condor numbers dramatically declined in the 20th century due to agricultural chemicals (DDT), poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction. At the time the 27 remaining individuals were captured and put in a breeding program, which saved the species. Since then, their population has grown. |

Pocket Gopher | NT | Also known as the Mazama pocket gopher, they are excellent at digging leading to higher regional plant diversity. The gophers are only found in one state, Washington.  There are believed to be up to five thousand Roy Prairie Pocket Gophers in Washington, but this could be as low as two thousand.  If this is correct, and the number of gophers keeps declining, this could severely affect their inhabited prairies.|

Sperm Whale | VU | The sperm whale has the largest brain of any creature in the world.  They are also the loudest creature on Earth, with their communication clicks measuring 230db.  This is louder than a space shuttle launch exhaust, an earthquake on the Richter scale of 5.0, and only a little quieter than the atomic bombs dropped on Japan. There are an estimated 1,997 sperm whales in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, approximately 4,000.|

Bald eagle | LC | The US' iconic national bird was nearly wiped out after decades of hunting, habitat loss, and the use of DDT, a toxic pesticide that had severely contaminated waterways, then fish, then the animals consuming those fish, including the bald eagle. By the 1960s, just 487 nesting pairs of bald eagles were alive. The species was then added to the Endangered Species Act, and DDT was banned. Populations soared, and bald eagles were federally delisted in 2007. |

Bighorn Sheep | T2 | The Sierra Nevada bighorn is named after the range it inhabits.  The sheep’s terrain is rocky, rough, and steep, which they use to escape predators. The Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep population dropped dramatically over the last century, from a population well over 1,000 to 100 animals in 1995. Since the sheep were added to the Endangered Species Act in 1999,  numbers have increased to over 600 animals.|

Jackrabbit | T2 | According to Mexican Official Norm, it is critically endangered, with less than 1,000 Tehuantepec jackrabbits living in isolated subpopulations. The biggest to Tehuantepec jackrabbits are fragmentation, habitat loss, small population size, poaching, and genetic isolation. The presence of the Tehuantepec jackrabbit in the ecosystem is crucial for maintaining the stability and structure of the communities where it resides. |

Key Deer | T1 | The Key deer inhabits Florida keys and is one of the most endangered deer. Key deer are endangered due to hunting, habitat loss, car accidents, illegal feeding by humans, disease, climate change, and other human activities. Only 700 to 800 individuals of key deer still exist in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to increase the critical deer population. They form an essential part of the ecosystem.|

Beluga Whale | LC | Cook Inlet Beluga whales are found arctic regions where the water is covered by ice. Since 1979 the number of Cook Inlet Beluga whales has decreased by 80%. According to a 2018 report, only 279 Cook Inlet Belugal Whales are left. The main threats the Cook Inlet Beluga whale faces are noise, catastrophic events, disease agents, effects of multiple stressors, unauthorized take, habitat loss, predation, reduction in prey, pollution, and subsistence hunting.|

Florida Panther | T1 | The Florida Panther inhabits tropical hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and mixed freshwater swamp forests. In 1970 there were only 20 Florida panthers in the wild, but by 2017, their population increased to 230. However, it is still endangered. The main threats to Florida panthers are poaching, habitat fragmentation, predation, habitat loss, automobile collisions, habitat degradation, and development. Mercury poisoning is also a severe threat to this animal.|

Pygmy Raccoon | T1 | Pygmy Raccoon is critically endangered because only 250 to 300 individuals remain worldwide.  The main threat to this cute animal is the development of Cozumel island. Recent research shows that parasites and diseases also reduce their population.|

Mexican prairie dog | T2 | Mexican prairie dogs became endangered because people used them to treat agricultural pests. Hurricanes, dogs, and feral cats also threaten this animal. Merely 250 mature Mexican prairie dogs are currently living in the world. Mexican prairie dogs play a crucial role in the ecosystem by creating a burrows system and extensive tunnels. Spending time in the tunnels moves the seeds further inside the soil and dramatically enhances water filtering.|

Pronghorn | T1 |The Baja California pronghorn is native to Baja California in Mexico. According to recent work, the estimated population of Baja California pronghorn is 200 wild individuals at the moment. The main threats to Baja California pronghorn are cattle ranching, habitat destruction, and poaching. The pronghorn requires conservation measures to increase its population. |

Cougar | LC | The scarcity of prey, natural territory loss, and human predation are the main reasons for its population reduction. Although it is not near extinction, conserving this animal species going forward is adviceable to prevent its loss.|

Tundra Wolf |LC | Baffin Island Tundra Wolf is small in comparison to other wolves. The Baffin Island wolf is endangered, although very little is known about the causes of reduction in their population.There is a strong need for further in-depth research to protect the Baffin Island wolf from becoming extinct.|

Wood Bison | VU |  The Wood Bison has decreased in numbers due to habitat loss, hunting, diseases, fragmentation, and human intolerance. Recent reports reveal that only 7,000 wood bisons remain. In Alaska, the population of wood bison has gone fom 140 to 92. As the wood bison is a fundamental part of Canadian identity and culture, losing it will result in significant economic and ecological value.|

Agouti | NT | The population of Coiban Agouti is declining, but the exact remaining population is uncertain. Its decline is attributed to loss of habitat. Coiban Agouti is found on an island which is affected by threats such as hurricanes and rising sea levels. There is very little knowledge about the ecology and habitat of Coiban Agouti.|

Howler | T2 | Coiba Island Howler is a monkey native to Panama. Only about 472 remain in the wild. More studies must be conducted on the Coiba Island Howler to generate proper planning to protect this animal from becoming extinct.|

Marmot | T1 |The population of Vancouver Island Marmot in 2003 was merely 30. However, due to various recovery programs, their population increased to 250 to 300 by 2015. The main threat to this North American animal is predation – specifically by the golden eagle, great wolf, and cougar. Climate change also threatens their population. The species must be protected because, as herbivores, they have a fundamental role in the grasslands ecosystem.|

Hispaniolan Hutia | T2 |Hispaniolan Hutia is a rat-like mammal that is small in size and native to the Caribbean Island of Hispaniola forests. It is primarily threatened by hunting, habitat loss, invasive species, habitat destruction, and direct use as a crop pest. The exact number remaining is not known, but the evolutionary distinctiveness makes this species of high value for global mammal conservation.|
